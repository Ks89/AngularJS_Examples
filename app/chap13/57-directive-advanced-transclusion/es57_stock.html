<div class="stock-dash">
    <span ng-transclude></span>
    <!--
     When angular encounters transclude, it clones the html before replacing it with the template or templateurl contents.
     Then, when it encounters ng-tranclude, it compiles the trancluded content, but links it to the parent scope
     instead of the isolated scope of the directive
     -->
