<!-- Any service can be simply injected into any other service, directive, or controller by stating it as a dependency.-->
<!-- Dependency injection states that instead of creating an instance of a dependent service when we need it,
     the class or function should ask for in instead. -->
<!-- Angular JS services are singleton for the scope of our application. This means that two controllers or services
     that ask for ServiceA will get the same instance.-->
<!-- User defined services use normal names. Otherwise, Angular buit-in services use name with a $ as prefix
 -->

<!-- Common angular js services:
     $window: wrapper around the global window object
     $location: allow to interact with url in the browser bar, and get and manipulate its value.
                These functions are available: absurl, url, path, search
     $http: allow to make GET and POST requestsm set headers and catching and deal with server responses and failures-->

<!-- We should create an AngularJS service if:
     1) It needs to be reusable
     2) Application-level state
     3) It's independent of the view
     4) It integrates with a third-party service
     5) Caching/factories -->
